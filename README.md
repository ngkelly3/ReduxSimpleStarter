# YouTube Clone

This app is a YouTube clone I made using React.  It's quite a bit faster than YouTube...

### Getting Started

Install dependencies using "npm install"
Run the app using "npm start"
Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to run the app

### Miscellaneous

The search field uses debounce to update the search query after an interval of time has passed
